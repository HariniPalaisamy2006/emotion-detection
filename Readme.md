# 📊 Emotion Detection from Social Media Posts

This project focuses on the **classification of emotions** in social media text posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset is small and illustrative, featuring posts tagged with one of several emotions such as *joy, sadness, anger, fear,* and *surprise*. This is a foundational step in building systems that can understand emotional tone in user-generated content.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this notebook, we:

1. Created a **synthetic dataset** of social media posts and labeled emotions.
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the data using standard NLP techniques.
3. Saved and loaded the dataset using **Pandas**.
4. Displayed the cleaned dataset for further analysis or model training.

## 📁 Files

* `social_media_emotions.csv` – CSV file containing text posts and their associated emotions.
* `Emotion_Classifier.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook (or Python script) containing data creation, cleaning, and preprocessing steps.
* `README.md` – You're reading it!

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **NumPy** – for numerical operations
* **re (Regular Expressions)** – for text pattern removal
* **NLTK** – for natural language processing and stopword removal

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

* Removed:

  * Null and duplicate entries
  * Very short messages (less than 3 words)
  * URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and numbers
* Lowercased all text
* Tokenized and removed **stopwords** using NLTK

Example transformation:

```
Original: "I just got a promotion at work!"
Cleaned: "got promotion work"
```

## 📌 Sample Dataset

| Text                                   | Emotion |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| I just got a promotion at work!        | joy     |
| I'm feeling really low today.          | sadness |
| That jump scare was terrifying!        | fear    |
| What a beautiful wedding.              | joy     |
| I'm furious about the delay in flight. | anger   |

## ✅ Output

After cleaning, the dataset is structured and ready for:

* Text classification models
* Visualization of emotion distribution
* Sentiment/emotion trend analysis

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Build a **machine learning model** (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning with LSTM) for emotion classification.
* Add more diverse and real-world data.
* Visualize word clouds or emotion distribution using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.

## 🔗 How to Run (Google Colab)

1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Install necessary libraries (`nltk`, `pandas`, etc.).
3. Run each cell sequentially.
4. Analyze the cleaned dataset or proceed to model training.
